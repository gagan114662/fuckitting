AlgoForge 3.0 — Final PRD: Fully Powered by Claude Code SDK
🎯 Mission
👉 Build a self-enhancing quant research lab that:
✅ Ingests and analyzes cutting-edge research
✅ Generates intelligent hypotheses
✅ Uses Claude Code SDK to produce, refine, debug, and optimize code efficiently
✅ Applies advanced validation
✅ Remembers, learns, and improves with each iteration
✅ Builds durable, live-ready trading portfolios

📌 Success Targets
✅ After slippage, fees, latency:

CAGR > 25%

Sharpe > 1

Max Drawdown < 20%

Avg profit per trade > 0.75%

✅ Pass OOS, WF, MC, param grid, crisis tests
✅ Survive 3+ months paper trading

🛠 Claude Code SDK — Tools We Will Use
Tool	Purpose
Code completion	Generate initial QC strategy code from prompt
Code editing / refinement	Clean, optimize, refactor existing code
Shell tool	Run linters, formatters (e.g. black, flake8), Git ops
File tool	Read/write config files, logs, code files for versioning
Bash scripting	Automate backtest submission, result parsing, git commit
Multi-turn conversation	Enable iterative refinement loop with Claude for each strategy
Streaming mode	Allow fast response + feedback during gen + refine

⚡ How Claude Code SDK will produce efficient code
✅ Refine strategy code after generation

Claude will auto-edit code for:

Vectorization (e.g. use NumPy instead of Python loops)

Code clarity (clear function names, docstrings)

Avoid repeated calculations (cache where needed)

✅ Shell tools will auto-run

Linters (flake8, pylint) — catch style + bug issues

Formatters (black) — enforce clean formatting

Static analyzers — flag inefficiencies

✅ Use Claude to auto-insert

Logging (info, debug, warning levels)

Inline comments for clarity

Parameterization — no magic numbers

✅ Code reuse + modularity

Claude will help structure code into functions/classes

Auto-create config files for parameters

✅ Performance awareness

Claude prompts will include instructions to:

"Generate efficient code that minimizes computational overhead and supports scalability for large backtests."

✅ Test generation

Claude generates unit test stubs or property tests for core logic

📋 Functional Requirements (Claude SDK-Powered)
ID	Requirement	Priority
FR1	Claude generates QC-compatible code efficiently	High
FR2	Claude refines code for vectorization, clarity	High
FR3	Claude uses shell tool to auto-run linters/formatters	High
FR4	Claude generates unit test stubs	Medium
FR5	Claude uses file tool to store code versions	High
FR6	Multi-turn refinement loop for code debugging	High
FR7	Shell tool automates backtest, parse, git ops	High

🛡 Risk Controls
Risk	Mitigation
Claude generates inefficient code	Always follow refine + linter + formatter pass
Shell tool misuse	Restricted command set; pre-approved ops only
Over-reliance on Claude	Validator + human review final code
Inefficient code unnoticed	Claude prompt includes efficiency directives; automated performance checks

🗄 Memory DB (Expanded with Code Efficiency)
Field	Type
Strategy ID	UUID
Code efficiency score	JSON (linter score, complexity metrics)
Refactor history	Text
Metrics + validation	JSON
Status	Enum
Lessons	Text
Timestamps	Datetime

🚀 Final Benefits
✅ Code is not just valid — it is clean, optimized, scalable
✅ Claude SDK powers the full developer loop — generate, refine, test, version
✅ Fewer errors, faster iteration, more robust strategies
