Recent studies on market dynamics have explored the intricate relationship between prevailing market volatility, often measured by indices like the VIX, and the efficacy of short-term momentum strategies applied to large-cap equities. While momentum investing generally presupposes trend persistence, periods of heightened volatility can introduce significant market chop, potentially eroding the performance of standard momentum models by causing frequent signal reversals and increased transaction costs. Some evidence suggests that during such turbulent phases, momentum strategies may experience diminished returns or even losses. However, ongoing research also indicates that adaptive momentum approaches, which might incorporate volatility metrics directly into their signal generation or position sizing rules, could potentially navigate these challenging environments more effectively. These adaptive strategies aim to either reduce exposure during unfavorable volatility regimes or adjust their parameters to better capture fleeting trends, though their consistent outperformance is still a subject of active investigation.
